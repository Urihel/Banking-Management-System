# Banking-Management-System

# Project Description:
This project you see here under the main.cpp file is just mearly a ficticious bank that allows you to open checking and savings accounts. as well as check your account balances. The libraries i am using to make this program work is **iostream, cmath, ctime, iomanip, fstream, and cstdlib**. In addition, we are also using an empty .txt file to collect the data I enter as ficticious clients, and later access that data to display account details such first and last name, phone number, as well as the account balance you currenty have in your account. 

Since i'm using windows 10 using fstream can bit a challenging. The purpose of fstream is to allow you read and write data to txt files.
